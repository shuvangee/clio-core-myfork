/**
 * test_cloud_factory_guard.cc - Always-on test of AssimilatorFactory protocol
 * dispatch for the cloud (s3://, gs://, gcs://) backends.
 *
 * This test does NOT touch any cloud service. It only checks the factory's
 * compile-time guard behaviour:
 *   - An unsupported protocol returns nullptr.
 *   - The always-available `file::` protocol returns a backend.
 *   - `s3://`   returns a backend iff CAE_ENABLE_S3 was compiled in, else nullptr.
 *   - `gs://` / `gcs://` return a backend iff CAE_ENABLE_GCS was compiled in.
 *
 * The factory is built with a null CTE client: the guard/unsupported paths
 * never dereference it, and the enabled paths only store it in the backend.
 * The test CMake passes CAE_ENABLE_S3 / CAE_ENABLE_GCS to this target so the
 * expectations track the build configuration.
