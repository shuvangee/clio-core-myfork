  // work to. This will not fix those, but it refuses to let them be SILENT,
  // which is the difference between "the cluster hung" and a diagnosable

  //
  // The signature it keys on is deliberately narrow: tasks are outstanding,
  // NOT ONE WORKER IS EXECUTING, and nothing has completed for the alarm
  // window. Everything parked with nothing running is a deadlock. Contrast a
  // merely slow runtime, where workers ARE executing — that is what the stall
  // detector below is for, and conflating the two would make this cry wolf on

  //     continuously, so an all-tasks counter never stops advancing. Polling is
  //     not progress; use RealTasksProcessed().
  // work_orch_ is null when LoadBalance is driven directly by a unit test
  // rather than by the WorkOrchestrator's monitor thread. The stall check below
