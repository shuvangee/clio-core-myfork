# Linux adapter matrix: build all five CTE I/O adapters and run their tests.
#
# Runs INSIDE the iowarp/deps-cpu image; ci-adapters.yml's linux-adapters job is
# a thin `docker run ... bash /workspace/CI/adapters_linux.sh` wrapper around it.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FILE AND NOT AN INLINE `bash -c '...'`, which is what it was:
# a single apostrophe inside one of the comments -- "the VFD C suite's tool
# matrix" -- closed the outer shell's quoting. Everything after it left the
# container script and was run by the RUNNER's shell instead, on a host with no
# HDF5 anywhere. The visible symptom was `required HDF5 tool missing from
# deps-cpu: h5dump` on an image that demonstrably ships h5dump, with the export
# that would have found it sitting right there in the echoed script. The whole
# test phase -- ctest, both compat suites, the mount smoke, xfstests -- silently
# never ran; the job failed on the first line after the build and looked like an
# image regression for three CI rounds. Quoting is not the place to be clever:
# in a file, an apostrophe is just an apostrophe.
#
# Usage:  CI/adapters_linux.sh [build-dir]      (default: build-adapters)

# --------------------------------------------------------------- HDF5 tool gate
# The HDF5 CLI tools are the differential oracle for both compat suites and for
# the VFD C suite's tool matrix. deps-cpu ships them, so a missing one is an
# image regression: fail rather than let the suites take their (locally correct)
# skip path and report green without the evidence. h5stat/h5clear are required
# too -- they are what the §1.1(b)/(c) gates are measured with.
#
# Self-diagnosing on failure. "tool absent", "PATH is not what we think" and
# "this is not even the shell you think it is" all produce the identical
# one-line symptom -- and the last of those was the actual cause, undetected
# through two speculative fixes because nothing in the output could separate
# them. `id` and `$PATH` alone would have named it in one run. Print what
# distinguishes them before exiting.
