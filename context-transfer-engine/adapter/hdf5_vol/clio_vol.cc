/**
 * Clio HDF5 VOL Connector — pass-through, native-authoritative.
 *
 * EVERY operation is delegated to the native VOL, which owns the file: the
 * on-disk HDF5 image is written synchronously and is the source of truth, so
 * standard tools read it live and CLIO can be removed without losing data.
 * On top of that, whole-dataset H5Dwrite/H5Dread transfers of flat datatypes
 * are additionally MIRRORED into the CTE tier as chunked blobs, and hyperslab /
 * point reads can be served from that mirror (serve-only; a miss falls back to
 * native). The cache is an accelerator, never an authority: any doubt about
 * whether it matches the file resolves by invalidating it and re-reading native.
 *
 * If the CLIO runtime is unreachable, or CLIO_VOL_CACHE=0 is set, the connector
 * degrades to a pure pass-through and remains correct. See README.md for
 * configuration.
